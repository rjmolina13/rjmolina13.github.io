It started with the enrollments as the council were actively assisting with the event. I would carefully observe you with my eyes but I wasn’t that interested, yet. 
You would ask me things and stuff about enrollment and I would be answering you nonetheless, even the most trivial stuff. Time came and I became slowly interested in you. We would casually have small talks and such and surely at a slow pace, I became immersed with every conversation we’d have. 
Our council would always meet, as we’d have our meetings and activities. I would enjoy your company, your chikas and such. I would laugh as you continue to spill your musangs. I would listen as you tell me stories and as I became your outlet for venting stuff. 
You would become vulnerable to me as you show me that side of you unfiltered, I soon, became vulnerable too as I show you the real me, my flaws and everything. 
I would just found myself surprisingly attached to you. I enjoyed every second I had with you. I loved every moment. Our frequent dates and our lakads together. 
I love experiencing stuff and enjoying every activity we would have. I love holding your hands, your waist and above all I really love your hugs! 
It felt really genuine, everything felt real. If only I could have all the time in the world and experience time slowly with you. 
That would be the greatest gift. Here I am writing this love letter or some sort as I become silly and smiling. 


ps. I love hearing you sing! You have a beautiful smile and above all a good heart.
